🛒 Amazon Frontend Page

This is a simple Amazon-inspired frontend page built using HTML and CSS. It aims to mimic the basic structure and styling of the Amazon website. While the page is functional, it is not responsive and may not adapt well to different screen sizes or devices. 🌐

Features

🛍️ A visually similar layout to the Amazon homepage.

🎨 Basic styling implemented using CSS.

🧩 Key sections like the header, search bar, product grid, and footer.

How to Run

🚀 Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>

🖥️ Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

🎉 Enjoy exploring the design!

Limitations

❌ Not Responsive: The page is not designed for mobile or tablet views, so it may not display properly on smaller screens.

🛑 Static Content: All content on the page is static and non-functional (e.g., buttons, links, and search bar).

Possible Improvements

📱 Add responsiveness using media queries.

⚙️ Include interactivity using JavaScript.

🔍 Implement dynamic features like a working search bar and product filtering.

Screenshot

🖼️ Include a screenshot of your Amazon frontend page here to give users a preview.
